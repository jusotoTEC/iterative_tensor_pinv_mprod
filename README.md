## Description

* This repository contains the MATLAB code for numerical experiments presented in the paper "*An iterative method for computing the tensor pseudoinverse of third-order tensors using adaptable tensor-tensor products*".
* This scientific paper is under review in a scientific journal.
* This paper proposes a family of high-order iterative methods for computing the tensor pseudoinverse of third-order tensors under a general tensor-tensor product framework. The approach is formulated in terms of the $M$-product. The resulting scheme is adaptable with respect to both the chosen tensor-tensor product and the desired convergence order $s\geq 2$. We establish global convergence of the proposed iteration to the $M$-product tensor pseudoinverse for arbitrary third-order tensors. We further analyze the method's computational complexity in terms of floating-point operations and provide a perturbation analysis that yields explicit bounds on error propagation, supporting the algorithm's stability. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive with, and often faster than, state-of-the-art iterative schemes for approximating tensor pseudoinverses while maintaining high accuracy. We also demonstrate its effectiveness on reconstruction tasks arising from the least-squares tensor approximation problem, including 3D signal enhancement, color image denoising, and video deblurring, where reconstructions obtained with the proposed approximation closely match those computed using the exact tensor pseudoinverse.
